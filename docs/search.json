    "text": "After a few years of running ArchLinux on my NAS PC, I recently (a couple weeks ago?) decided to switch to a solid foundation of Debian Stable (Bullseye 11.4 at the time of this post), with most of my userland apps installed via Flatpak.\n\n\n\nFlatpak\n\n\nOne is not better than the other, but I was tired of having to regularly check for updates, decide if they looked important, check the homepage for any breakage news, etc. It’s not so bad for a desktop that is used for tinkering and playing, but for a fileserver running programs that I’d rather not restart all the time (hold on, let me pause this show on Plex and make sure my backup NAS isn’t syncing)…\nSo far so good. The overall system is smaller (due to Debian breaking up packages while Arch installs the kitchen sink at times), and it makes my root backup tarball smaller since I can leave out the flatpak directory and focus on the actual system."

    "text": "Flatpak Notes\nAnyway, the main notes that I meant to put here are:\n\nflatpak remote-add flathub flathub-url is not the same as sudo flatpak remote-add flathub flathub-url\n*For a single-user system there’s not that much real difference in terms of the experience, but installing flathub without sudo only installs the repo for YOU and then any apps you install get saved in /home. You do you.\nFlatpak apps are installed at /var/lib/flatpak, so keep that as a separate BTRFS subvolume to exclude them from root backups.\nFor apps, MakeMKV in particular, the app’s personal root is /app/, not /.\nUser config files and data are mostly stored per-app in ~/.var/, but some apps have access to /home/user.\nAdd /var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin to you $PATH to more easily call the apps from the command line, in case error codes need to be looked at.\n\nOverall I’m pretty happy with the change. Most of the gui programs that I use are in flathub, so that’s pretty easy. I was worried about bloat and performance, but it’s really not that bad. Apps are sandboxed, yes, but they can share Flatpak libraries and runtimes so there isn’t so much redundancy. It’s really nice when installing a single Gnome app or Wine not to have to install an entire suite of Gnome apps and multi-lib stuff just for one program."

    "text": "In this sort of environemnt, the suite of Power tools: PowerBI, Power Query, Power Pivot, etc. is a good choice. As a bonus, they play nicely with OneDrive and SharePoint, and PowerBI allows for automated data updating.\nIn my day-to-day I run into situations where I need to combine several Excel files that are split into chunks, say some sort of accounting information that is saved in separate files per year. Power Query’s GUI can help to get you started, but if you need to do any more complicated data wrangling you’ll need to dive into M code.\nA common template I use for the above scenario is something like this:\nlet\n  // Navigate to the SharePoint library (not folder) with the files.\n  Source = SharePoint.Files(\n    \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/personal/tyler_contoso_com\",\n    [ApiVersion = 15]\n  ),\n  \n  // Filter the file list down to the correct folder\n  #\"Filtered Folders\" = Table.SelectRows(\n    Source, \n    each [Folder Path] = \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/personal/tyler_contoso_com/Documents/Documents/Widget Exports/\"),\n    \n  // Filter down to just the right files.\n  // In this example, the files are named \"2022 Widget_Exports.xlsx\", \n  // \"2021 Widget_exports.xlsx\", etc.\n  #\"Filtered Files\" = Table.SelectRows(\n    #\"Filtered Folders\", \n    each Text.Contains([Name], \"Widget_Exports.xlsx\")\n    ),\n    \n  // Excel Opener Function\n  ExcelOpener = (folderPath, fileName) => \n  let\n    // This function nested in the main function processes all of\n    // the Excel files in the same way. It does not change the\n    // column types yet, that is saved for the end. I have had the \n    // column type information get tossed out in a following step,\n    // that's why it doesn't get defined here.\n    // The function does name the columns. \n    SelectFile = #\"Filtered Files\"{\n      [Name = fileName, \n      #\"Folder Path\" = folderPath]}[Content],\n      \n      #\"Imported Excel\" = Excel.Workbook(SelectFile, null, true),\n      \n      #\"Navigation\" = #\"Imported Excel\"{\n      [Item = \"Sheet\", Kind = \"Sheet\"]\n      }[Data],\n      \n      #\"Filtered rows\" = Table.SelectRows(\n        // If there are any merged cells, this can toss unnecessary rows\n        #\"Navigation\", each [Column2] <> null),\n        \n      #\"Promoted headers\" = Table.PromoteHeaders(\n      #\"Filtered rows\", [PromoteAllScalars = true]\n      )\n  in\n    #\"Promoted headers\",\n  \n  // To use the function, make a new column and get its values from the\n  // function. It will be a nested data column.\n  #\"Added Custom\" = Table.AddColumn(\n    #\"Filtered Files\", \n    \"Custom\", \n    each ExcelOpener([Folder Path], [Name])\n    ),\n  \n  // We can remove everything but the new column  \n  #\"Removed columns\" = Table.RemoveColumns(\n    #\"Added Custom\", \n    {\"Content\", \"Name\", \"Extension\", \"Date accessed\", \n      \"Date modified\", \"Date created\", \"Attributes\", \n      \"Folder Path\"}\n    ),\n  \n  // Expand the column and select all of the named columns  \n  #\"Expanded Custom\" = Table.ExpandTableColumn(\n    #\"Removed columns\", \n    \"Custom\", \n    {\"Acct No\", \"Cust No\", \"PO\", \"Transaction Date\", \"Widget Type\", \n      \"Widget Cost Per Unit\", \"Total Units\", \"Total Cost\", \n     \"Shipped\", \"Shipped Date\"}\n    ),\n  \n  // Now we will set the column types\n  #\"Changed column type\" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(\n    #\"Expanded Custom\", \n    {\n      {\"Acct No\", type text}, \n      {\"Cust No\", type text}, \n      {\"PO\", type text}, \n      {\"Transaction Date\", type date}, \n      {\"Widget Type\", type text}, \n      {\"Widget Cost Per Unit\", type number}, \n      {\"Total Units\", Int64.Type}, \n      {\"Total Cost\", type number}, \n      {\"Shipped\", logical}, \n      {\"Shipped Date\", type date}\n      }\n    )\nin\n  #\"Changed column type\"\nUsing code similar to this will combine the directory full of files into one big Power dataset that you can now modify as needed for the analysis or report that you are using."

They have many different containers all built in layers on each other so it’s easy to find a good starting point for running R/shiny apps, or building a general dev environment like I was looking for.\n\n\nAdding on Layers\nAt the time of this post I chose the rocker/tidyverse image to build my RStudio environment, but this could change in the future (see my repo for the latest). Having Rstudio server and the tidyverse packages gets me 90% of the way to where I want to be, but there are other packages that I use quite a bit. To get those packages I would either need to\n\nOption 1:\n\nSpin up an image,\nDownload the packages in the image\nSave that modified environment as a new image via docker commit\n\nOption 2:\n\nCreate a Dockerfile and let docker build handle it\n\n\nI am a big fan of keeping things simple, reproducible, and mostly in line with the intended workflow (sometimes rules are made to be broken, but I am not familiar enough with docker to be getting my hands that dirty just yet), so I went with Option 2.\n\n\nConfiguration\nAt the time of this post, this is my Dockerfile:\nFROM rocker/tidyverse:4.2.1\nCOPY packages.R /home/rstudio/packages.R\nRUN R -q -e \"source('/home/rstudio/packages.R')\" \\\n    && rm -rf /tmp/* \\\n    && strip /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/*/libs/*.so\nI start with the rocker/tidyverse:4.2.1 image, then copy an R script into the rstudio home directory:\ninstall.packages(\n         c(\n           \"markdown\",\n           \"gt\", \n           \"DT\", \n           \"kableExtra\", \n           \"flextable\", \n           \"huxtable\", \n           \"reactable\", \n           \"formattable\", \n           \"pixiedust\", \n           \"agricolae\", \n           \"car\"\n         )\n)\nAfter the script is run, I execute 2 more commands to clean up the image (as advised by the Rocker team). This image is available on Docker Hub as tclark89/tidyverse-extra\nOne day I may dig more deeply into setting up my own very custom image by building something more from scratch, but for now the rocker/tidyverse image works as great jumping-off point.\n\n\nCompose\nNow that the image has been created it needs to be spun up, and it needs to be run with certain parameters. The best way to do that is with a docker-compose.yml file. Currently mine looks like this:\nservices:\n  rstudio:\n    image: tclark89/tidyverse-extra:4.2.1\n    ports: \n      - \"8787:8787\"\n    environment:\n      PASSWORD: rstudio\n      ROOT: true\n    volumes:\n      - ~/.config/rstudio:/home/rstudio/.config/rstudio\n      - ~/.local/share/rstudio:/home/rstudio/.local/share/rstudio\n      - ~/code/R:/home/rstudio/workspace\nThe docker-compose.yml file starts the rstudio service:\n\nUses my custom docker image as the base\nMaps the container ports\nSets the rstudio user’s password and gives it sudo via  environment variables\nMaps some directories to be shared between host and container. This lets settings and files persist in my /home directory between sessions.\n\nThe rocker team provides an example  compose file as well.\n\n\nRunning the Container\nAll it takes to run the docker container now is to cd to the directory with the docker-compose.yml file and issue the command: docker compose up. However, I would like for this to happen automatically so I can just login and go. There may be a different way to do this, but I went with a systemd service file.\nAfter some digging through the Arch Wiki and various SO posts I settled on the following:\n[Unit]\nDescription=%i service with docker compose\nPartOf=docker.service\nAfter=docker.service\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nRemainAfterExit=true\nWorkingDirectory=/home/%u/docker/compose/%i\nExecStart=/usr/bin/docker compose up -d --remove-orphans\nExecStop=/usr/bin/docker-compose down\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nThis service file is a user @.service, so the file is named docker-compose@.service and called via:\n\nsystemctl start --user docker-compose@tidyverse-extra.service\n\nor for a persistent setup:\n\nsystemctl enable --now --user docker-compose@tidyverse-extra.service\n\nBecause docker compose looks for a docker-compose.yml file in the working directory, I needed to specify one in this file and make sure that directory existed in my /home. The %u makes this file user-agnostic and the %i and @ make it usable for any other docker service I may decide to use later. I just need to make sure that I create a directory in ~/docker/compose/ and put the docker-compose.yml file there.\nAs a final note, this will only work if your user is part of the docker group, otherwise docker needs root privileges. This file could just as easily be made to work as root, but the docker-compose.yml file would need to have absolute paths instead of user-relative ones."

Then I can just git pull and get back to work on this website or whatever project I am focused on.\nFor now this all works wonderfully. I don’t have to muck around with dependencies on my server, and saving the docker files to GitHub and the image to Docker Hub means that it should be reproducible in case I can’t access the server. For instance, if I am away from home but want to work on a project I can spin up the docker image directly on my Chromebook (via the built-in Linux VM) and fire away. In fact, you can even run this image in a browser via Play with Docker, though it eats up quite a bit of RAM to do so."

This image is available on Docker Hub as tclark89/tidyverse-extra\nOne day I may dig more deeply into setting up my own very custom image by building something more from scratch, but for now the rocker/tidyverse image works as great jumping-off point.\n\n\nCompose\nNow that the image has been created it needs to be spun up, and it needs to be run with certain parameters. The best way to do that is with a docker-compose.yml file. Currently mine looks like this:\nservices:\n  rstudio:\n    image: tclark89/tidyverse-extra:4.2.1\n    ports: \n      - \"8787:8787\"\n    environment:\n      PASSWORD: rstudio\n      ROOT: true\n    volumes:\n      - ~/.config/rstudio:/home/rstudio/.config/rstudio\n      - ~/.local/share/rstudio:/home/rstudio/.local/share/rstudio\n      - ~/code/R:/home/rstudio/workspace\nThe docker-compose.yml file starts the rstudio service:\n\nUses my custom docker image as the base\nMaps the container ports\nSets the rstudio user’s password and gives it sudo via  environment variables\nMaps some directories to be shared between host and container. This lets settings and files persist in my /home directory between sessions.\n\nThe rocker team provides an example  compose file as well.\n\n\nRunning the Container\nAll it takes to run the docker container now is to cd to the directory with the docker-compose.yml file and issue the command: docker compose up. However, I would like for this to happen automatically so I can just login and go. There may be a different way to do this, but I went with a systemd service file.\nAfter some digging through the Arch Wiki and various SO posts I settled on the following:\n[Unit]\nDescription=%i service with docker compose\nPartOf=docker.service\nAfter=docker.service\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nRemainAfterExit=true\nWorkingDirectory=/home/%u/docker/compose/%i\nExecStart=/usr/bin/docker compose up -d --remove-orphans\nExecStop=/usr/bin/docker-compose down\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nThis service file is a user @.service, so the file is named docker-compose@.service and called via:\n\nsystemctl start --user docker-compose@tidyverse-extra.service\n\nor for a persistent setup:\n\nsystemctl enable --now --user docker-compose@tidyverse-extra.service\n\nBecause docker compose looks for a docker-compose.yml file in the working directory, I needed to specify one in this file and make sure that directory existed in my /home. The %u makes this file user-agnostic and the %i and @ make it usable for any other docker service I may decide to use later. I just need to make sure that I create a directory in ~/docker/compose/ and put the docker-compose.yml file there.\nAs a final note, this will only work if your user is part of the docker group, otherwise docker needs root privileges. This file could just as easily be made to work as root, but the docker-compose.yml file would need to have absolute paths instead of user-relative ones."

Then I can just git pull and get back to work on this website or whatever project I am focused on.\nFor now this all works wonderfully. I don’t have to muck around with dependencies on my server, and saving the docker files to GitHub and the image to Docker Hub means that it should be reproducible in case I can’t access the server. For instance, if I am away from home but want to work on a project I can spin up the docker image directly on my Chromebook (via the built-in Linux VM) and fire away. In fact, you can even run this image in a browser via Play with Docker, though it eats up quite a bit of RAM to do so."

It’s good practice to include the TRUE ~ result statement at the end. Sometimes you may want an “other” result, other times you may just want to make sure that you’ve caught all the rows.\nFor a more detailed example:\n\n# Let's load some libraries:\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n# I'll use mtcars, and we'll look at the car model\nmtcarsMod <- mtcars |> \n  rownames_to_column(var=\"model\")\nhead(mtcarsMod)\n\n              model  mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\n1         Mazda RX4 21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\n2     Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\n3        Datsun 710 22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\n4    Hornet 4 Drive 21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\n5 Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\n6           Valiant 18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n\n\nLet’s say that we want to add the manufacturer as a separate column. There are a few ways to do it:\n\nNested if_else\nThe first way that always enters my head is to do nested if_else statements. It’s not terrible when there are only a few options, but they get ugly fast:\n\nmtcarsMod |> \n  mutate(make = if_else(grepl(\"Mazda\", model), \"Mazda\", \n                        if_else(grepl(\"Hornet\", model), \"Hornet\",\n                                if_else(grepl(\"Merc\", model), \"Mercury\",\n                                        if_else(grepl(\"Datsun\", model), \"Datsun\", \n                                                # etc.\n                                                \"Other\"))))) |> \n  select(make, names(mtcarsMod)) |>\n  rmarkdown::paged_table()\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple mutates\nOne way to make things cleaner is to do multiple mutates. Create the new column with your “catch-all” value, then use conditional statements that leave the new column unchanged when the condition is FALSE:\n\nmtcarsMod |> \n  mutate(\n    make = \"Other\",\n    make = if_else(grepl(\"Mazda\", model), \"Mazda\", make),\n    make = if_else(grepl(\"Hornet\", model), \"Hornet\", make),\n    make = if_else(grepl(\"Merc\", model), \"Mercury\", make),\n    make = if_else(grepl(\"Datsun\", model), \"Datsun\", make)\n    # etc.\n  ) |> \n  select(make, names(mtcarsMod)) |>\n  rmarkdown::paged_table()\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\ncase_when\nBut the cleanest way (IMHO) is to use case_when. I don’t know why I always forget about it, but maybe the act of making this post will permanently etch it into my brain.\n\nmtcarsMod |> \n  mutate(make = case_when(\n    grepl(\"Mazda\", model) ~ \"Mazda\",\n    grepl(\"Hornet\", model) ~ \"Hornet\",\n    grepl(\"Merc\", model) ~ \"Mercury\",\n    grepl(\"Datsun\", model) ~ \"Datsun\",\n    # etc.\n    TRUE ~ \"Other\"\n  )) |> \n   select(make, names(mtcarsMod)) |>\n  rmarkdown::paged_table()"
