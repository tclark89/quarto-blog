## Bio

I have been working as a data analyst and statistician since 2016, and
  have always had a passion for learning, technology, and getting 
  things done. In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with computers
  and software, playing and writing music, settling in for a long
  session with my charcoal smoker, or just getting outside.
