I am a data analyst by trade, which I largely credit to my long-time
  Linux and software hobbies. 

This is a website where I keep code snippets, thoughts, 
  interesting analyses, or just whatever enters my mind. 
  

This entire website is written using Quarto and Rstudio, and available 
  on 
  <a href="https://github.com/tclark89/quarto-blog">GitHub</a>
