## Lithograph Data

Let's look at an example of creating a set of X-bar and S charts.
  We'll use the 
  [Lithograph](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/datasets/LITHOGRA.DAT) 
  dataset from the NIST handbook. This data measures the width of lines
  etched on 5 locations of silicon wafers. 
  There are 3 wafers per cassette, and 30 cassettes for a grand 
  total of 450 measurements. 
  
There are many different approaches we could take to how to group this
  data, but for now, lets consider the cassette as our "run" and examine
  the distribution of line widths for each cassette, regardless of the
  wafer number (1, 2, or 3) or the location of the line. 
  
### Reading the data

We'll use `readr::read_fwf()` to read this data since it is in a 
  fixed-width format. We'll also drop the last column as it is not
  necessary (see the text in the file header for more details).
```{r}
#| label: load-litho-data
#| message: false
library(readr)

# LITHOGRA.DAT ####
# The width of a line on a silicon wafer
fileLitho <- read_file("https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/datasets/LITHOGRA.DAT")
# add blog link after publishing?

dataLitho <- read_fwf(
  fileLitho, 
  col_positions = fwf_widths(
    c(7, 7, 7, 12, 7, 12),
    col_names=c("CASSETTE", "WAFER", "SITE", "LINEWIDT", "RUNSEQ","LINEWIDT_2")
    ),
  skip=25
) |> 
  subset(select=-c(LINEWIDT_2))

head(dataLitho)
```
