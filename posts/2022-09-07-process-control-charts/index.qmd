## Process Control Charts

Process Control Charts are great for analyzing any sort of process and identifying
  shifts in the process and outliers. They are a fundamental part of the Six Sigma
  program. 
  
There are R libraries for making these charts:

- [qcc](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qcc/index.html)
- [qicharts2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qicharts2/vignettes/qicharts2.html)
- [ggQC](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggQC/index.html)
- [And many more...](https://www.google.com/search?q=process+control&domains=r-project.org&sitesearch=r-project.org)


But I prefer to do them from scratch for more customization.

There are 3 main types of SPC Charts:

- X-Bar and S (Std. Dev, >10 samples per run/group)
- X-Bar and R (run range, <= 10 per run/group)
- X-Bar and M (change from run to run, when there is only 1 measure per group)
