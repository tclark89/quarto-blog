When I first started out doing data analysis professionally,
  I tried not to stray from base R. Why? I'm not sure. After all,
  I had to install something to read Excel files... 
  At any rate, at some point I decided to have IT install 
  <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/">RStudio</a>'s 
  IDE on my laptop and to try out this 
  "<a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a>" thing.

**Mind Blown**

Just the `%>%` operator alone radically changed my workflow and caused
  me to refactor all of my code. Then learning how to use all of the 
  data manipulation tools in `dplyr` (`mutate`, `select`, `separate`,
  oh how I could go on) made working with data exciting and intelligible
  instead of some chore full of arcane commands and confusing code.
  
RMarkdown and now Quarto have given me many new avenues for reporting
  data, results, and analysis, even though I am still heavily tied 
  to having to email an Excel file
  for some of the old-school folks (I guess if it ain't broke...).
  Well, that's why I learned some VBA too.
