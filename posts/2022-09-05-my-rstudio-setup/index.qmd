## Backstory

I wrote in a 
  <a href="../2022-09-04-flatpak/index.qmd">previous post</a>
  that I am working on making my home NAS PC more stable, which means
  moving more of the userland packages to containers. Most 
  of the programs I use on that PC (Firefox, VLC, Gimp, etc.)
  all have flatpaks that work quite well for me. 
  
However, R and RStudio are not in that category. On Debian, both
  require going outside of the official Debian repositories:
  R has a repository for up-to-date versions, while RStudio
  does not (although they do provide binary downloads). Add to that
  the system dependencies of some packages and now there are random
  libraries installed all over, with no depends chain in apt.
  
It seemed to me that R would need it's own environment.
  How best to do that? I turned to
  <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> for this particular
  case.
