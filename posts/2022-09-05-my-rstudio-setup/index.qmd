## Backstory

I wrote in a 
  <a href="../2022-09-04-flatpak/index.qmd">previous post</a>
  that I am working on making my home NAS PC more stable, which means
  moving more of the userland packages to containers. Most 
  of the programs I use on that PC (Firefox, VLC, Gimp, etc.)
  all have flatpaks that work quite well for me. 
  
However, R and RStudio are not in that category. On Debian, both
  require going outside of the official Debian repositories:
  R has a repository for up-to-date versions, while RStudio
  does not (although they do provide binary downloads). Add to that
  the system dependencies of some packages and now there are random
  libraries installed all over, with no dependency chain in apt.
  
It seemed to me that R would need it's own environment.
  How best to do that? I turned to
  <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> for this particular
  case.

## Docker Setup

### Base Image

Luckily, smarter people than myself have already run into this situation
  and started the 
  <a href="https://rocker-project.org/">Rocker Project</a>. They
  have many different containers all built in layers on each other
  so that it's easy to find a good starting point for running R/shiny 
  apps, or building a general dev environment like I was looking for. 

### Adding on Layers

At the time of this post I chose the `rocker/tidyverse` image to build my
  RStudio environment, but this could change in the future (see my 
  <a href="https://github.com/tclark89/tidyverse-extra">repo</a>
  for the latest). Having Rstudio server and the tidyverse packages
  gets me 90% of the way to where I want to be, but there are other 
  packages that I use quite a bit. To get those packages I would either
  need to 
  
- Option 1:
  - Spin up an image, 
  - Download the packages in the image
  - Save that modified environment as a new image

- Option 2:
  - Create a Dockerfile with the appropriate steps

I am a big fan of keeping things simple, reproducible, 
  and mostly in line with the intended workflow
  (sometimes rules are made to be broken, but I am not familiar enough
  with docker to be getting my hands _that_ dirty just yet) 
  so I went with Option 2. 

### Configuration

At the time of this post, this is the Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM rocker/tidyverse:4.2.1
COPY packages.R /home/rstudio/packages.R
RUN R -q -e "source('/home/rstudio/packages.R')" \
	&& rm -rf /tmp/* \
	&& strip /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/*/libs/*.so
```

I start with the `rocker/tidyverse:4.2.1` image, then copy an
  R script into the rstudio home directory:

```r
install.packages(
		 c(
		   "markdown",
		   "gt", 
		   "DT", 
		   "kableExtra", 
		   "flextable", 
		   "huxtable", 
		   "reactable", 
		   "formattable", 
		   "pixiedust", 
		   "agricolae", 
		   "car"
		 )
)
```

After the script is run, I execute 2 more commands to clean up the image
  (as advised by the 
  <a href="https://rocker-project.org/use/extending.html#install-binary-packages">Rocker team</a>). 
  This image is available on 
  <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tclark89/tidyverse-extra">Docker Hub</a>
  as `tclark89/tidyverse-extra`
  
### Compose 

Now that the image has been created it needs to be spun up, and it needs to
  be run with certain parameters. 
  The best way to do that is with a `docker-compose.yml` file.
  Currently mine looks like this:
  
```yml
services:
  rstudio:
    image: tclark89/tidyverse-extra:4.2.1
    ports: 
      - "8787:8787"
    environment:
      PASSWORD: rstudio
      ROOT: true
    volumes:
      - ~/.config/rstudio:/home/rstudio/.config/rstudio
      - ~/.local/share/rstudio:/home/rstudio/.local/share/rstudio
      - ~/code/R:/home/rstudio/workspace
```

The `docker-compose.yml` file starts the `rstudio` service:

- Uses my custom docker image as the base
- Maps the container ports
- Sets the rstudio user's password and gives it sudo via 
  <a href="https://rocker-project.org/images/versioned/rstudio.html#environment-variables">
  environment variables</a>
- Maps some directories to be shared between host and container. This lets 
  settings and files persist in my `/home` directory between sessions. 
  
The rocker team provides an example 
  <a href="https://rocker-project.org/images/versioned/rstudio.html#editing-work-on-rstudio-server">
  compose file</a> as well. 
  
  
### Running the Container

All it takes to run the docker container now is to `cd` to the directory with
  the docker-compose.yml file and issue the command: `docker compose up`. 
  However, I would like for this to happen automatically so I can just login and
  go. The final piece for me was a systemd service file.
