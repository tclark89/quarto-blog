## A Distro-hopping Tale

After a few years of running <a href="https://archlinux.org/">ArchLinux</a>
  on my NAS PC, I recently (a couple weeks ago?) decided to switch to a
  solid foundation of 
  <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/">Debian Stable</a>
  (Bullseye 11.4 at the time of this post), 
  with most of my userland apps installed via Flatpak.

One is not better than the other, but I was tired of having to regularly
  check for updates, decide if they looked important, check the homepage
  for any breakage news, etc. It's not so bad for a desktop that is used
  for tinkering and playing, but for a fileserver running programs that
  I'd rather not restart all the time (hold on, let me pause this show
  on Plex and make sure my backup NAS isn't backing anything up...)
  
So far so good. The overall system is smaller (due to Debian breaking
  up packages while Arch installs the kitchen sink at times), and it 
  makes my root backup tarball smaller since I can leave out the 
  flatpak directory and focus on the actual system.

## Flatpak Notes
Anyway, the main notes that I meant to put here are: 

1. `flatpak remote-add flathub flathub-url` is **not** the same as `sudo flatpak remote-add flathub flathub-url`

    *For a single-user system there's not that much real difference in terms
    of the experience, but installing flathub without sudo only installs
    the repo for YOU and then any apps you install get saved in /home. 
    You do you.
  
2. Flatpak apps are installed at `/var/lib/flatpak`, so keep that as
  a separate BTRFS subvolume to exclude them from root backups. 
  
3. For apps, MakeMKV in particular, the app's personal root is /app/, not /.

4. User config files and data are mostly stored per-app in ~/.var/, 
  but some apps have access to /home/user.
  
5. Add /var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin to you $PATH to more easily call the
  apps from the command line, in case error codes need to be looked at.
  
Overall I'm pretty happy with the change. Most of the gui programs that
  I use are in flathub, so that's pretty easy. I was worried about bloat
  and performance, but it's really not that bad. Apps are sandboxed, yes,
  but they can share Flatpak libraries and runtimes so there isn't so much
  redundancy. It's really nice when installing a single Gnome app or Wine
  not to have to install an entire suite of Gnome apps and multi-lib
  stuff just for one program.
