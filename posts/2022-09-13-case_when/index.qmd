This is a very small post that's really more of a note-to-self. I wind up using 
  nested `if_else` statements a lot, but `dplyr` contains a nifty function that
  really eliminates the need for them and in turn cleans up the code. The 
  `case_when` function operates very similarly to `CASE WHEN THEN ELSE` in SQL:

**SQL**
```sql
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN x = 1 THEN 'a'
    WHEN x = 2 THEN 'b'
    WHEN x = 3 THEN 'c'
    ELSE 'd'
  END  
```

**dplyr**
```r
case_when(
  x == 1 ~ "a",
  x == 2 ~ "b",
  x == 3 ~ "c",
  TRUE ~ "d"
)
```
