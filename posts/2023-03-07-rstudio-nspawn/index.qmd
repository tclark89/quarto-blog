For some time now, I have been running RStudio Server at home via some 
  sort of [Docker configuration](../2022-09-07-my-rstudio-setup/index.qmd).
  The [Rocker Project](https://rocker-project.org/) makes this relatively
  easy to set up, but there are some downsides I have been struggling
  with, namely library management. Restarting the docker image means
  re-installing all my additional libraries, system fonts, etc. There
  is always the option of building a docker image that installs that 
  stuff, but then I have to make sure it's up to date too. 
  I also don't really like the idea of saving the account password as
  plain-text in the docker-compose.yml file, 
  even if it's only for that docker app. 
  
The first alternative I tried was a virtual machine, but that was a bit
  clunkier than I really wanted. I access my server almost exclusively 
  from my Chromebook via SSH or web interfaces, so I had to setup
  [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/) to access the VM via
  a web browser for the initial setup, and use the browser to setup
  network bridges, set RAM and CPU, etc., etc. As with the Docker image,
  this can definitely work, but wasn't really what I wanted.
